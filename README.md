1.	Knowledge Building

Researchers are actively working on identifying the complex relationship between GDP per capita, happiness and life satisfaction (Aral & Bakir, 2022; Proto & Rustichini, 2014). 
It is essential to deeply understand this relationship because of scientific and policy perspectives (Proto & Rustichini, 2013). From a scientific perspective, the debate is important because it helps to understand how income affects life satisfaction and happiness in order to develop policies that can improve the quality of life for citizens. From a policy perspective, the debate is important because it can help to inform policy decisions (Proto & Rustichini, 2013). If higher income is associated with higher life satisfaction and happiness, then policies that focus on increasing income may be more effective in improving the quality of life for citizens.
Additionally, as it is mentioned this relationship is complex. For example, although life satisfaction and happiness are considered the same by the majority, they are not synonymous and their relationship with GDP per capita can differ greatly. According to research by Ortiz-Ospina and Roser (2013), a positive correlation between GDP per capita and life satisfaction is commonly observed, with higher GDP per capita typically corresponding to higher levels of life satisfaction (Degutis et al., 2010). However, it is important to note that this correlation is not necessarily causal and higher GDP per capita does not always result in higher levels of happiness. For example, studies by Stanca (2010) and Clark and Senik (2011) have found that sharp increases in GDP per capita in richer countries do not necessarily have a significant impact on overall happiness.
While analysing this relationship, it is best to see GDP per capita, happiness and life satisfaction maps to understand how their overall relationship is: Figure 1 demonstrates the average GDP per capita in the XXI century:

Figure 1. GDP per capita in the 21st century
According to Figure 1, Europe and North America, regions have higher GDP per capita in comparison with other regions so, they should have higher happiness and life satisfaction. However, it's important to note that GDP per capita is just one indicator of a country's or region's economic situation and should be considered in conjunction with other economic and social indicators to get a more comprehensive understanding of the overall situation (Rodriguez-Pose & Maslauskaite, 2011). Additionally, according to Aral and Bakir’s (2022) spatial analysis, even the countries in the neighbourhood influence happiness and life satisfaction rate. Figures 2 and 3 demonstrate the average Happiness and Life satisfaction rate in the XXI century, respectively and it is easily can be seen that generally, happy countries are surrounded by happy countries as well as the countries which have higher life satisfaction:

Figure 2. Happiness rate in the 21st century
 
Figure 3. Life satisfaction rate in the 21st century
As it is mentioned happiness and life satisfaction are different indicators and their relationship with GDP per capita is different so, it is easily can be seen in these maps that although GDP per capita is a strong factor that determines higher life satisfaction, it cannot totally explain happiness. Regions like North America and Europe have higher GDP per capita and life satisfaction; however, the happiness map shows us that regions like Southeast Asia and some South America and Middle Eastern countries also reach the highest happiness rates. 
At last, to see a clear relationship between these notions and to see the big picture, 4th and 5th figures demonstrate the relation between GDP per capita and happiness, and GDP per capita and life satisfaction respectively:

 
Figure 4. Happiness and GDP per capita

 
Figure 5. Life satisfaction and GDP per capita
Figures 4 and 5 demonstrate the correlation between GDP per capita and happiness and life satisfaction. While life satisfaction has a strong correlation with GDP per capita, happiness does not show the same strong correlation. These results are exactly the same as we observed on the maps and researched in the literature. 
 In conclusion, our research found that there is a positive correlation between income and life satisfaction, but not necessarily with happiness. This suggests that money does play a role in overall life satisfaction, but it may not be the sole determining factor in one's happiness. These findings have important implications for individuals and policymakers in the 21st century, as they highlight the need to consider factors beyond just income when striving for overall well-being.

1.2	 Data sets
In this report, 3 different data sets on the Our World in Data web page have been used: “GDP per capita in US-Dollar” data set (Our World in Data, 2022), “Share of people who say they are happy” (Our World in Data, 2016) and “Happiness Cantril Ladder” (Our World in Data, 2022). “GDP per capita in US-Dollar” time coverage is 1960-2020, “Share of people who say they are happy” is 1984-2014 and “Happiness Cantril Ladder” is 2003-2020. Because of our analysis focus, only XXI-century data is utilized. 


2.	Theoretical frameworks
To create visualizations in this report, the ASSERT framework was extensively used. The ASSERT framework is one of the crucial tools for creating good and more based visualizations because it draws attention to 5 essential steps in creating visualizations: Ask, Search, Structure, Envision, Represent and Tell (Ferster & Shneiderman, 2013; Rees & Laramee, 2019). 
1.	Ask: The starting point of this report was a question: Can high-income or money purchase happiness or life satisfaction in the XXI century? The main hardness of this question is that there are a variety of different answers to this question, although some research suggests that happiness and life satisfaction are subjective and high income does not have any impact on that, other research states that happiness and life satisfaction have a linear relationship (Ugur, 2019; Muresan et al., 2019). 
2.	Search: While searching for the data sets some important points are needed to focus on:  First, data should be accurate and up to date. Second, data should be relevant to the question being asked and can be used to create a meaningful visualization. It is identified that data on life satisfaction, happiness, and GDP per capita is needed to answer a question. To ensure data quality data set has been found on the Our World in Data web page which has various open-source and reliable data sets. 
3.	Structure: The first step in structuring the data set is to filter it for years (Year>1999), so it helps us to focus on only the XXI century. The second step is to find the average GDP per capita, happiness and life satisfaction for the XXI century. So, this makes it possible to create maps which demonstrate average happiness, life satisfaction and GDP per capita and do spatial analysis. The third step is to merge average data sets and delete N/A values, so we can do some correlation graphs to see the relationship between GDP per capita and, happiness and life satisfaction. 
4.	Envision: After structuring the data, it is important to find a strategy for visualising the data. It is decided that doing spatial analysis and showing the obvious patterns of happiness, life satisfaction and GDP per capita is the first step in our strategical analysis. Because after this step, the reader can easily be aware of the general trend in the world. After indicating the general trend and giving background information about the topic, answering the main question is our second and main step: Creating the GDP per capita and happiness, and GDP per capita and life satisfaction scatter plots to show associations. 
5.	Represent: While creating maps (Figures 1,2,3) viridis colour scheme has been used. It is used to create a range of colours from light to dark. According to Braun et al. (2022), viridis colour scheme is better to show the difference between different points and Kaspar and Crameri (2022) add that viridis scheme is one of the most easily readable colour schemes. In our maps, brighter colours demonstrate the high rate of GDP per capita, happiness and life satisfaction while darker colour shows a lower rate. Additionally, grey colour is used to indicate the “No data” variable. Map theme from “ggthemes” package is preferred over the void theme because it helps us to create a more readable map. In figures 4 and 5 same colouring scheme was used because of the same reasons, moreover “high chart theme” (theme_hc) was preferred. This theme is designed to make the data stand out more clearly. Additionally, different sizes of points are used to show GDP per capita change in the charts. 
6.	Tell: Storytelling is a process that turns the abstract plot into a meaningful story (Lee et al., 2015). Storytelling can be used to entertain, educate, and inspire. If visualizations are used correctly, it makes the overall story highly effective (Ma et al., 2012). In the storytelling process in this report, maps are used for the introduction to the overall topic and after these scatter plots are used with the text to answer the main question and deepen the knowledge between main topics. Figueiras (2014) also mentioned that for the introduction part maps are useful. For drawing conclusions and finalising the point of the story scatter plots are used because they are more useful for detailed analysis. 


3. Accessibility
Accessibility in visualization is the practice of designing visualizations that are accessible to all users, regardless of their physical, cognitive, or technological abilities. This includes making sure that visualizations are easy to understand, can be used with assistive technologies, and are compatible with different devices and platforms. It also involves considering the needs of users with disabilities, such as colour blindness, low vision, and hearing impairments. Additionally, it is important to note that accessibility is one of the hardest points to evaluate in visualisation because there is not any commonly accepted list of rules (Elavsky et al., 2022).

3.1 Advantages and disadvantages of used visualisations
According to Elavsky et al. (2022), the most misused details in the data visualisations are colour contrasts and font size. 
 
Figure 1.
In Figure 1, the colour contrast is spectacular. To avoid the most common type of colour blindness red and green have not been used together.  The main aim of the map has been reached and it is obviously demonstrated the higher and lower GDP per capita countries. Readers easily can differentiate the countries because the white line has been used to show the borders, however, it is not a perfect map. Font sizes can create trouble for readers because they are small and at first glance, it is not convenient to understand the caption and meanings of colours. Moreover, the projection of maps can create speculations. The Mercator Projection is used to demonstrate GDP per capita, happiness and life satisfaction, however, the Mercator projection distorts the size and shape of large objects, such as continents and countries. Areas closer to the poles appear larger than they actually are, while areas closer to the equator appear smaller. To see the disadvantages of this projection we can look at figure 2:

 
Figure 2. Happiness rate in the 21st century
As it is mentioned countries which are close to the poles have been projected so much bigger than they really are, so this map can create the understanding that the big portion of the world considers itself as happy. To surpass these maps (Figure 1,2,3) font sizes should be increased and The Mercator projection can be replaced by other projections like “The Peters Projection” or “The Winkel Tripel Projection”. 
On the other side, charts (Figure 4,5) do not have problems like font sizes and projection.
 
Figure 4. Happiness and GDP per capita
 
Figure 5. Life satisfaction and GDP per capita

Colours have been chosen carefully to minimise colour blindness and additionally, a size variable has been used to show the GDP per capita so that readers easily comprehend the increasing direction of it by looking at the size of points rather than the whole graph. In both charts, the minimalist approach has been used and only essential points have been shown. 
Although, they are not perfect charts either. It is really hard to define which point is showing how much GDP per capita is without looking at the whole graph. Additionally, in the charts point sizes are explained only for the GDP per capita over the 20000 USD.  
4. Visualisation choice
In this report, two types of visualisations have been used: map and scatter plot. Both of these visualisations have some benefits and drawbacks and in the next sections, they are discussed in more detail.
4.1 Scatter plot
Scatter plots are a great way to visualize the association between two variables. They can be used to identify trends, patterns, and outliers in the data. Scatter plots can also be used to compare different groups or to look for correlations between variables. Additionally, scatter plots can be used to identify clusters or groups in the data. Although scatter plots are considered flexible, high dimensionality and a high amount of data cannot really be visualised on scatter plots (Sarikaya & Gleicher, 2018; Sedrakyan et al., 2019).
In the 4 and 5 figures, scatter plots have been used to visualise the association between GDP per capita and happiness, and GDP per capita and life satisfaction. As it is mentioned above, the ultimate goal of a scatter plot to help readers to understand the relationship between two variables and it is provided. Readers easily can see the relationship between life satisfaction and GDP per capita (Figure 5) is stronger than the GDP per capita and happiness relationship (Figure 4). Moreover, the low dimensionality in our data and the small amount of data make scatter plots the best way to visualise it.
As an alternative one correlation plot can be used instead of two scatter plots. Correlation plots are mainly used in more detailed and statistical analyses, and they reduce the interactivity of text and can be boring for readers, so scatter plots are preferred. 
4.2 Map
Map visualizations are a great way to convey information quickly and easily. They can be used to show the geographic distribution of data, compare different regions, and identify patterns and trends. Maps can also be used to illustrate relationships between different variables, such as population density and economic activity. Additionally, maps can be used to show the impact of natural disasters or other events on a region. Finally, maps can be used to help people make decisions, such as where to locate a business.
In our analysis, the 1,2,3 figures are maps and they have mainly used for giving general information about the topic. There are two main aims for using maps as visualisation choices: First, they are preparing the readers for the final point of the topic and help them to fully understand the relationships between GDP per capita, happiness and life satisfaction. For instance, a reader after looking at the map and additionally scattered plot can fully understand which countries and which parts of the world are happier and what exactly brings happiness to them. Additionally, maps are visually appealing and can be used to engage viewers in a way that tabular data cannot. This can be especially useful when presenting data to a non-technical audience.

5. Implications and Improvements
5.1	 Ethical implications
Creating visualisations of GDP per capita, happiness and life satisfaction can have several ethical implications, including:
1.	It may perpetuate the idea that GDP and material wealth are the primary determinants of happiness and life satisfaction which can be problematic if it leads to a neglect of other important factors that contribute to well-being, such as social connections, mental and physical health, and access to education and opportunities. Research of each decade strongly suggests that happiness is a strongly subjective emotion and it is not possible to explain it with income, GDP per capita or briefly money (Easterlin, 1995; Easterlin, 2005; Wang & Murnighan, 2013). So, it is important to mention that GDP per capita is not the main determinant of happiness when these visualisations are used. 
2.	It may also perpetuate the idea that certain countries or regions are inherently happier or less happy than others, which can lead to harmful stereotypes and discrimination.
3.	Additionally, it can be misleading to compare happiness and life satisfaction levels across different cultures, as different cultures may have different understandings and expressions of happiness and life quality.
4.	The data used to create the scatter plot and maps can also be unreliable or biased, leading to inaccurate conclusions.
It is important to consider these ethical implications when creating and interpreting a scatter plot of GDP per capita and happiness and to use caution when making generalizations or drawing conclusions from the data.
5.2 Improvements over the visualisations
To enhance the effectiveness of the visualizations in conveying the story being told in the report, several improvements can be made:
1.	One such improvement is to add trend lines and correlation measures, such as R-squared or correlation percentages, to scatter plots. This can help to clarify the direction of changes and the degree of correlation between variables, reducing the potential for misinterpretation and misuse of the data. Additionally, according to Robertson et al. (2008), it is good to use trend lines in the scatter plot if the variation of data is small. 
2.	Another way to improve this report is to add a scatter plot which shows the relationship between happiness and life satisfaction. As it is mentioned in the first section life satisfaction and happiness are different perceptions, and it is also can be essential to show an association between them for demonstrating the whole picture. 
3.	One more way to improve this report may be to add a correlation plot. A correlation plot is generally used to show overall correlation and it can easily demonstrate an association between GDP per capita, happiness and life satisfaction in one plot. As it is mentioned correlation plot has not been used because it decreases the interactivity of the story but it also can be preferred by different researchers.
5.3 Conclusion
In conclusion, this report highlighted the relationship between GDP per capita, happiness, and life satisfaction using various visualizations and the ASSERT framework. The maps provided a clear picture of the distribution of GDP per capita, happiness, and life satisfaction across the world. The scatter plots also helped to visualize the correlation between GDP per capita and happiness or life satisfaction. The use of the ASSERT framework allowed for a more thorough analysis of the data and provided a deeper understanding of the relationship between these variables. The visualizations provided a clear understanding of the relationship between these variables and helped to support the argument that money does not necessarily buy happiness in the 21st century. Additionally, the report has also discussed the ethical implications and improvements that should be taken into account while creating visualizations. Overall, the use of the visualizations and the ASSERT framework in this report provide valuable insights into the relationship between GDP per capita, happiness, and life satisfaction.
